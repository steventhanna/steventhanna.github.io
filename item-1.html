		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<em>I'm a Student, Software Developer and Designer from Chicago, IL.</em>
		<p>
			My interest with computers and technology stems from my early childhood, when my parents brought home an old IBM desktop.  Ever since, I devour all the information I can get my hands on regarding tech, and development.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the workplace, I push myself to deliver stellar products with robust backends, and beautiful UI Designs. I am currently working on several projects, as well as studying Computer Science full time.
